Traditionally, it has been a difficult for network operators to guarantee consistent policies to in-flight packets during configuration transitions, leading to potentially insecure or undefined network behavior during the transition period. It is possible that the transition process briefly allows propagation of malicious traffic, causes packets to be dropped, or incurs bandwidth degradation. For example, a flow of packets through a network would be disrupted during the transition if one switch using an older configuration forwarded packets to another switch with a conflicting, newer configuration.

Here we reproduce the results originally published in M. Reitblatt et al. "Abstractions for Network Update" [^1] presented at SIGCOMM'12. The results table summarizes many experiments, reporting the number of modified switch rules, or operations (Ops), and maximum switch overhead for each individual run. In addition, we investigate the number of required update operations over a range of network sizes to examine the scalability of this framework. The results can be found in the accompanying text files and plots.

##Instructions to Replicate This Experiment:

1. Sign up for Amazon EC2

2. Create a new instance of the AMI on region US â€“ West (Oregon) with ID `ami-ec1782dc`. We recommend using a c1.xlarge instance for better performance.

3. SSH into this AMI using the `-A` option to enable forwarding of the authentication agent connection. This will allow you to clone our Github repository from your instance. Optionally, use the `-X` option for X-Window forwarding to view the output plots.

4. In the home directory, run: 

		git clone git://github.com/cocushio/cs244_pa3.git

5. Navigate into `cs244_pa3/updates`.

6. To reproduce the table run for 192 hosts (5 minutes):

		sudo ./run_single.sh

7. To reproduce a plot with the number of operations run:

		sudo ./run_all.sh
		
	This should take 20 minutes to run with the default settings. For a faster run, run with 1 or 2 flavors (Line 48).

8. To reprodude the timing plots (Figures 2 and 3 in the blog, update the disable experiment mode by setting Line 26 of `updates/run_all.sh` to EXPERIMENT=0. Then, run:

		sudo ./run_all.sh

This step will take around 60 minutes to run.

Examine the generated HTML tables and PNG images for the results. They are located in the generated `latency-<timestamp>-<experiment>` subdirectories.

Note: To enable multicast (an additional 15-20 minutes), uncomment the line in the run_all.sh script (Line 46).


###Additional Notes 
When troubleshooting, make sure to kill any rogue processes using the following commands:
  
	sudo ps -ef  
	sudo killall ofdatapath 
	sudo killall ofprotocol
	sudo killall python
