Google is mostly worried about space used by mechanism, and probably about the issue of chasing your own tail

space constrained two-phase commit
two concerns: responsivity and rule overhead on the switches

Maybe two models: 1) controller bottleneck, so # of commands
2) switch bottlenecks, so installing 10 rules on 1 switch is worse than 1 rule on 10 switches

Multicast
Mac-learning
NAT

implement Nate's desired changes to NXtopo

26 Dec

Nate to keep working on examples

Nate/Dave to write up cleaned up NSDI Header Analysis stuff

Jen to work out common configuration changes, come up with example for Cole that involves packet rewriting

Evaluation? 
	    - No wall clock

For me: Canonical infrastructure for push-button example and stats tabulation
Try to do per-flow
    - Implementation strat: on ingress switches, for ingress rules, use time-outs then do refinement

 What do we keep from Dave's model, and how do we reconcile it with Cole's model

 Questions for Dave:
   Head space papaer actually did talk about switches, it was just inconsistent. For future work, what if we just model the whole thing as a bunch of ports connected together

   Why not do a regular LTS instead of passing the traces (augmented packets) around?

   - Because this allows us to precisely record the trajectory of a single packet through the network
   Wonder if t should be symmetric, except for world/drop and if the links are bidirectional:
   "Definition: External port: 
   		a port p is an external port if it is not WORLD or DROP and t(p) = WORLD.
		External(p,t) is valid if p is an external port.

    Definition: Internal port: 
    		a port p is an internal port if it is not WORLD or DROP and t(p) not= WORLD
		Internal(p,t) is valid if p is an external port.
    "
